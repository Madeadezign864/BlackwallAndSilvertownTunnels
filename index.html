              The new charges apply from 7 April 2015. By now they should be well into the charging regime. I say a regime because it is part of Mr Khan's roundabout approach to get funding for newly built Silvertown tunnel.
              Here we want to highlight these tunnel charges, a contentious topic for the next Mayor of London, but also the penalties being handed out for unsuspecting motorists who live outside of London, and 
              who may have been caught in the PCN net.

                      From 7 April 2025 charges will apply to both the Blackwall Tunnel and the new Silvertown Tunnel. If you drive through either tunnel, you will need to pay each time you cross, unless you or your vehicle are exempt from paying the charge.
                      Charges will apply from 06.00-22.00, 7 days a week in both directions. The tunnel will be open 24 hours a day every day of the week.
                    <br> The toll charges for the **Blackwall and Silvertown tunnels** vary based on the time and type of vehicle.

              <h2 style="text-align: center;padding-bottom:20px;">Are the Penalties fair? </h2>
              <p>I received a fine for travelling through the tunnels, but I was ignorant to the new charges. I was fined £180 both ways (with 50% discount) as I didn't pay in 3 days. 
                I also didn't have a valid excuse, apart from the poor signage. When I phoned, the lady said there was sufficient signage, and also it had been announced on TV, 
                although she didn't have exact dates. I seldom watch the regular TV channels so I missed out on the news. I have heard nothing on the radio either in the last few months.
                I try to catch up with news on the internet, but there was no warnings or reminders about Blackwall and Silvertown tunnel charges starting in April.
                Strangely enough, the signage didn't exactly jump out at me. There was a lot of traffic, so I missed the sparse signage.
              </p>
              <h3 style="padding: 50px 0px 20px 0px;text-align: center;">I decided to check the effectiveness of the signage</h3>
              <p>I went out on a Sunday and took some videos. I started at my house then entered Blackwall tunnel from the south . I then returned from the north. When I tried to pay for the charges bothways;
                I realised you have to pay the full £4 but I was travelling on the weekend. Does this mean the MON-FRI charges don't apply and why pay more online than account holders? 
                Traditionally online payments of any kind attract some form of discount, because they involve less paperwork. 
                It seems that the whole pricing table is so difficult to understand? So you must now phone in, then get ID-eed, they want all the details, 
                and you must open an account with TfL, and leave card details for auto-payments.
                Then they've got you! <strong style="color:blue"> Conclusion:</strong> <u>Payment system is not straightforward.</u>  The motorist is simply there to milk. 
                <strong style="color:red"> Warnings </strong>about the new Blackwall and Silvertown charges: <u>virtually not existant.</u><strong style="color:blue"> 
                  Then there is the signage: </strong> <u>Signage too faint, 
                and in small lettering, too small to even notice. </u>
                TfL will be reaping millions from first time offenders who were not properly informed, and who missed the subtle signage.
