# BlackwallAndSilvertownTunnels
what is this?
A blog about Penalty charges for the two tunnels, Blackwall and Silvertown that cross under the Thames river in London.

The blog has a comments section at the foot of the page provided by Powd. It is important that users interact and leave a comment.

The plight of the blog is the feeling that the penalty charges are too harsh. The grace period to pay is not significant because drivers may be completely in the dark about the charges
and only notified after DVLA has checked the registrations of the cars some 5 days later. The grace period to pay is only 3 days.

Reasons most drivers don't pay 
The main reasons most drivers don't pay is poor signage, and virtually no warnings whatsoever.
No News bulletings apart from news bulletins on 7 April when the charges came into being.

How many drivers were caught?
It is suspected that literally thousands of cars were caught in the net and having to pay penalties.
These penaties are high averaging £90 per crossing possible even £180 if not paid in 14 days.

It is hoped that the public will participate to leave comments and this will somehow call the local council to action and install more effective signage to warn drivers of the charges.

There are bigger problems that if addressed could wipe out CO2 omissions forever. These are reducing the number of cars on the road, due to all the associated costs with an increase in cars, 
which incidentally are now being made to travel faster and made larger for more comfort, things like increased costs associated with accidents, parking problems and time wasted looking for spaces and a host of other 
associated costs of having more cars on the road. These new EV cars are heavier (due to heavy batteries) and are contributing to the destruction of British roads. Other motorist are preferring heavier 4 x 4 vehicles
to couteract the pervasion of potholes, which catch22 are cause by heavier vehicles and more of them.

Buyers of new cars should opt for smaller electric cars. More use should be made of off-peak trains reducing the need for families to have more than one car.
