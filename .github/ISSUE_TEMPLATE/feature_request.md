**There is a problem with the tendency to install penalties to fund government projects**
[I am amazed the lack of signage and warnings to 'Pay the Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnel charges' 
in the roads leading into the tunnels. Signs are styled with small writing which are easily missed by motorists. 

The charging system is designed to get every motorist to sign up to TfL London. Your ID is taken along with your vehicle registration and your bank card details. Then you are put on an auto-payment system which is purported to save you money on charges. 

If the Silvertown tunnel needs funding why are Blackwall tunnel users charged? There are a lot of other reasons why CO2 omissions exist. One being too many cars on the road and new petrol and diesel cars being built heavier, and faster than their predocessors ? 

New cars may also be EVs but they are still heavier, and contributing to the damage on our roads, and the pothole nightmare. They are even bought to avoid the damage potholes do to the suspension of the vehicle. They are also faster creating more accidents, because speed is the highest contribution factor to accidents on the roads. There is also the problem of families owning more than one car. Its considered a status symbol so this is difficult to change.

**The solution *
Consider the example of the Netherlands. They are much more environmentally conscious and have less cars and more bicycles, ensuring the car problem doesn't get out of hand, like the problem with too many cars in Britain. Instead they have converted to bicycles and have destroyed the myth of the car as a status symbol. Could we not learn some lessons from the Dutch? It's not rocket science but radical steps are needed to bring about a paradigm of change for Britain.

**Alternatives you've considered**
Convert city transport to bicycles, trams, trains, buses, walking. Exclude cars from cities. Increase the ISA thresholds to enable people to save more money thereby creating another avenue of wealth. By reducing the stain of payment for cars, more personal wealth could be diverted towards the ever increasing mortgages, allowing homeowners to pay off their homes sooner. This will mean money presently sent on financing a vehicle, repairs, accident costs, loss of life though accidents, and depreciation of assets can all be removed in one sweep. A radical change on vehicle ownership.

This change will include selling your second and third cars, using trains off-peak, thereby increasing funding for new train lines and trams development. Trains and trams are still the most economical way to travel because they use less energy per passenger than any other transport type.]
